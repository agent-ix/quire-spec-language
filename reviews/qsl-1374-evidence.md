## Summary

Ticket: QSL-1374; PR 1959. The new acceptance criteria declare Test verification and describe observable record, cause, population-node, and meter outcomes. The catalog advisor did not return within 120 seconds, so its deterministic recommendation pass could not be confirmed; manual review found no authored-method mismatch.

## Verdict

**LIMITED** — Manual review supports Test for the new observable cases, but quoin advise could not be completed in this run.

## Review Policy

No applicable AssuranceProfile with an enforced review policy was found in `spec/`; this review used the direct review path.

## Method Note

`quoin advise --json` was started twice and produced no output for more than 120 seconds; it was interrupted. The authored `Test` methods were assessed manually. Catalog recommendation results remain unverified.
