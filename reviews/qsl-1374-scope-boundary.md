## Summary

Ticket: QSL-1374; PR 1959. FR-106/QSL package admission owns population selection and checks 7/8; FR-390 defines the typed occurrence inputs; FR-401 explicitly excludes these wrappers and snapshot admission from quire-eval. No component ownership conflict was found.

## Verdict

**PASS** — Responsibilities remain allocated across QSL layer 4/5 and the shared evaluator leaf.

## Review Policy

No applicable AssuranceProfile with an enforced review policy was found in `spec/`; this review used the direct review path.
