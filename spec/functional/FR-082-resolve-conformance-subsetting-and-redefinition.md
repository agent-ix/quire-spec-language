# FR-082: Resolve conformance, subsetting and redefinition over the closed declaration set

## Description

When checking a specialization, a subsetting feature or a redefining member
against the declaration it narrows, the model checker SHALL decide conformance
over the closed ancestor graph the admitted domain package declares. The model
checker SHALL check every independent variance axis the redefined member kind
defines. The model checker SHALL report every failing axis rather than
stopping at the first.

This requirement is QSL's own binding of quire-specification
[FR-151](ix://agent-ix/quire-specification/FR-151)'s conformance and
redefinition rules into the compiler's behavior. It does not restate FR-151's
axis table; it states the checker's exhaustiveness, boundedness and refusal
contract for applying it.

## Inputs

- The effective view [FR-081](FR-081-preserve-model-correspondence-and-declaration-identity.md)
  produces, and each effective declaration's declared `supertypes`, `subsets`
  and `redefines` edges.
- Field value types and typed multiplicities; operation parameter types,
  multiplicities, result types and declared effect frames (`modifies`,
  `creates`, `deletes`).
- Established postcondition facts available for a narrowing field
  redefinition's refinement obligation.
- `ModelNormalizationLimitsV1`.

## Outputs

For each checked redefinition or subsetting relation: an admitted conformance
result, or a `Refused` outcome carrying every failing axis (member kind, axis
name and typed cause), or a typed incomplete result naming the exhausted
charge point.

## Behavior

### Conformance is closed-graph reachability, not a display match

The model checker SHALL decide that a type `S` conforms to a type `T` exactly
when `S` and `T` are the same effective type or a chain of declared
`supertypes` edges reaches `T` from `S`, walked over the admitted domain
package's own declared edges only. It SHALL NOT treat two declarations that
share a display name, and are not the same effective declaration, as
conforming.

### Every independent axis is checked, and every failure is reported

For a redefining field, the model checker SHALL check the value-type axis,
the multiplicity axis and the refinement-obligation axis independently. For a
redefining operation, it SHALL check arity, each parameter's type and
multiplicity, the result type and multiplicity, and effect-frame inclusion
independently. It SHALL charge one unit of conformance work before each axis
runs, and it SHALL collect every failing axis of the member under check into
one `Refused` outcome rather than returning after the first failing axis.

### Unequal arity carves out the parameter axes

Arity is checked first. When a redefining operation's parameter count does
not equal the redefined operation's, the model checker SHALL refuse with a
type-mismatch cause naming the arity difference and SHALL NOT check any
per-parameter type or multiplicity axis for that pair — there is no
parameter-by-position correspondence to check across an unequal parameter
list. The result-type, result-multiplicity and effect axes remain
independent of arity and are still checked and reported on their own. This
is quire-specification [FR-151](ix://agent-ix/quire-specification/FR-151)'s
arity row ("equal parameter count; when unequal, no parameter axis is
checked"), which this exhaustiveness requirement's own "every independent
axis is checked" rule above does not override.

### Subsetting and redefinition targets must exist and must not cycle

If a subsetting or redefining member names a feature that is not declared on
a supertype the owner conforms to, the model checker SHALL refuse it with a
redefinition-target cause naming the missing target. If the declared
`supertypes` edges of the admitted package contain a cycle, the model checker
SHALL refuse specialization for every declaration on the cycle with a
specialization-cycle cause, and SHALL derive no conformance edge across the
cycle.

### The refinement obligation admits no partial pass

A narrowing field redefinition SHALL be admitted only when an established
postcondition fact proves the narrowing; absent that fact, the model checker
SHALL refuse it with an unproved-refinement cause naming the missing
obligation kind. The model checker SHALL NOT admit a narrowing redefinition
on the strength of its declared shape alone.

### Ancestor and conformance walks are bounded

The model checker SHALL bound every ancestor-chain and conformance walk it
performs, at a fixed depth ceiling distinct from any `ModelNormalizationLimitsV1`
charge counter — the QSL implementation's `MAX_CONFORMANCE_DEPTH`
(`src/model/conformance.rs:99`), currently 128. If a walk would exceed the
bound, the model checker SHALL refuse with a resource-exhaustion cause naming
the bound and SHALL NOT report a conformance or non-conformance verdict for
that walk. Exceeding this depth ceiling is a `Refused` outcome (a real
defect: a redefinition family or ancestor chain deeper than the bound), never
the `Incomplete` outcome `ModelNormalizationLimitsV1`'s own axis-charge and
record-charge points produce when a charge is denied; the two are distinct
result variants over distinct counters, consistent with ADR-013 O-21 ("an
exhausted meter yields `Incomplete` with its charge point and limit; a stage
limit refuses with `LimitExceeded`").

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-082-AC-1 | Given a redefining operation whose parameter type, result multiplicity and effect frame each independently violate their axis, the checker's `Refused` outcome names all three failing axes with their own typed cause, not only the first one checked. | Test (TC-218) |
| FR-082-AC-2 | Given a member redefinition naming a target absent from any supertype the owner conforms to, and separately a declared `supertypes` cycle, each is refused with its own named cause (redefinition-target, specialization-cycle) and no conformance edge is derived across the cycle. | Test (TC-219) |
| FR-082-AC-3 | Given a conformance ancestor chain longer than the bound, the checker refuses with a resource-exhaustion cause naming the bound and reports neither conformance nor non-conformance for that walk; a chain at exactly the bound is admitted. | Test (TC-220) |
| FR-082-AC-4 | Given a narrowing field redefinition with no established postcondition fact proving the narrowing, the checker refuses unproved-refinement; given the same redefinition with the obligation established, the checker admits it. | Test (TC-221) |
| FR-082-AC-5 | Given a redefining operation whose parameter count differs from the redefined operation's, the checker's `Refused` outcome names exactly the arity failure with a type-mismatch cause and checks no per-parameter type or multiplicity axis for that pair; the result-type, result-multiplicity and effect axes are still independently checked and reported when they also fail. | Test (TC-239) |

## Dependencies

- **Upstream:** [FR-081](FR-081-preserve-model-correspondence-and-declaration-identity.md)
  supplies the effective declarations this requirement checks;
  quire-specification FR-151 owns the normative variance-axis table and
  AD-006 owns the model-view decision to keep conformance edges, subsetting
  and redefinition in the checked model view.
- **Downstream:** [FR-083](FR-083-resolve-unique-most-specific-dispatch.md)
  uses this requirement's conformance relation to decide dispatch
  applicability and dominance.
- This requirement's behavior touches the same compiler surface as
  [FR-068](FR-068-split-expression-checking-into-check-stage.md), which
  declares a bounded, temporary `model` → `check` import edge confined to
  exactly the names FR-068-AC-9 and FR-068-CON-5 list. This requirement does
  not alter, widen or contradict that edge; it specifies conformance and
  redefinition behavior only.
