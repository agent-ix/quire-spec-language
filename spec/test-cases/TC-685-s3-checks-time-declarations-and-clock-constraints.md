# TC-685: S3 checks time declarations, clocks, clock constraints, time invariants and urgency

## Description

Verify that S3 admits the `time` member, `Clock` fields, resets, clock constraints, time invariants and urgency, records them on the checked state model, and refuses every misuse at its span.

Scope: FR-230-AC-1 to FR-230-AC-4.

## Test Procedure

Fixtures: ADR-026 §11's `Rpc` unit with `T = 3 ms` and `T = 4 ms`, universe `{c}`; its `s`-unit variant; a tick variant; the refusal fixtures of FR-230-AC-2; a 64-clock model.

1. Check `Rpc` and its `time dense unit s` variant.
2. Check each refusal fixture of FR-230-AC-2.
3. Check the tick model with period `1/2 ms`, with period `0 ms`, and with an unresolved tick operation.
4. Check the disjunctive guard and the 64-clock model with the `10^40 ms` constant.

Tag the tests `#[trace("TC-685", "FR-230-AC-n")]`.

## Expected Results

- Step 1: `TimeSource::Dense{ms}`, clock `Call.x`, two time invariants, `send`'s reset, `reply`'s one convex part `x >= 1`; the `s` variant has bound `1/1000` and a different package identity.
- Step 2: each refuses with the code and span FR-230-AC-2 names.
- Step 3: `TimeSource::Tick` with period `1/2`; `invalid_model_binding`/`malformed-declaration`; `missing_declaration`/`missing-name`.
- Step 4: two convex parts each with `self.ready`; the large model checks with no refusal.
